# Translation Guidelines

The Rust website can be translated into multiple languages using [fluent](https://github.com/projectfluent) and [pontoon](https://github.com/mozilla/pontoon). Note that these features are currently in development.

## What can be translated

All text on the website can be translated. Some texts, especially policies, can be translated, but the English version will be the binding one.

## Forming a translation team

Translation teams for any language need at least _three_ members. This is to avoid translations to "drop out" of support too quickly. If you feel like having a team, please get in touch with the [community team](mailto:community-team@rust-lang.org) to apply for a translation. We'll make sure to get you set up.

Teams ideally consist only of native speakers. Even within one language it can be useful to have editors from multiple backgrounds, to find a consistent language. For translators, strong writing skills matter. For reviewing, a keen eye and a good feeling for oddities is important.

Any language that can muster a constantly working and up to date translation is qualified.

## How to get your translation published

You will have 2 weeks time for an initial translation of the page, after which we will start to check up on you.

If you finished your task and all members of the team agree that the translation is done, it will go to trial for another two weeks. In this time, we encourage people to read the translation and give feedback.

After this time, we evaluate the state of the translation with the goal to make it permanent. A permanent translation will be kept as long as changes are made within a reasonable time frame of them main language changing. Should a language drop out of support, we will make one attempt at getting in touch with the team and finding new members, then it will be removed.

## How to translate

Note: this section is minimal due to the final translation service being setup.

Translations are done via keys: for example, a key name `rust-claim` in the website source will expand to "A language empowering everyone..." in the English translation. Additional translations will override this key with their own phrase.

Each translation must be reviewed by a second member of the team for quality control.
