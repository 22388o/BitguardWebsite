## Why Rust? (templates/components/what/wasm/pitch.hbs)

wasm-why-rust-heading = Why Rust?

wasm-why-rust-predictable-alt = Gears
wasm-why-rust-predictable-heading = Predictable performance
wasm-why-rust-predictable-description =
        No unpredictable garbage collection pauses. No JIT compiler performance cliffs. Just low-level control coupled with high-level ergonomics.

wasm-why-rust-small-code-alt = A microscope
wasm-why-rust-small-code-heading = Small code size
wasm-why-rust-small-code-description =
        Small code size means faster page loads. Rust-generated <code>.wasm</code> doesnâ€™t include extra bloat, like a garbage collector. Advanced optimizations and tree shaking remove dead code.

wasm-why-rust-amenities-alt = Luggage
wasm-why-rust-amenities-heading = Modern amenities
wasm-why-rust-amenities-description =
        A lively ecosystem of libraries to help you hit the ground running. Expressive, zero-cost abstractions. And a welcoming community to help you learn.
